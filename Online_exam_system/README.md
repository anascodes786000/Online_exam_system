## 🎓 College Viva / Project Presentation Q&A

1. **How is the timer managed and how is cheating prevented?**
   - The countdown timer runs on the client-side using JavaScript `setInterval`. Even if the student attempts to modify the client timer, the server tracks start/submission timestamps and checks answer submissions against questions registered in the database.
   - The anti-cheat module monitors window blur and `document.visibilitychange` events to detect when a student leaves the exam window or switches tabs.
2. **How does automatic evaluation work?**
   - When the candidate submits, `app.py` compares the submitted radio button selections against the `correct_option` field in the `questions` database table. Score is calculated by summing the allocated marks for each correct choice, computing percentage, and determining pass/fail status against the quiz threshold.
3. **What database is used and why?**
   - SQLite3 is used because it is lightweight, serverless, ACID-compliant, and built into standard Python. It requires zero configuration on any machine.
